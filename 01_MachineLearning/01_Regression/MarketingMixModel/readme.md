Data set is borrowed from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazid28/advertising.csv?resource=download

This data set is related to Marketing Mix Model which helps in determining the market attribution. Using this fictional dataset we will try to predict the sales outcome based upon the spendingâ€™s on TV, radio and newspaper. 

I have tried to solve this problem using simple linear regression techniques. 

Thanks to - https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-simple-marketing-mix-model-with-ols-571ac3d5b64f blog which helped me understanding the data set better.
